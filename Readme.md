# Phrase object (with palindrome detector)

This is a sample (unpublished) NPM module created in [*Learn Enough JavaScript to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/javascript-tutorial) by Michael Hartl.

This does differ from Hartl's version in that I used a regex replace rather than matching on an array and joining, and I use an && to prevent matching on an empty string rather than ||.

Also added functionality for detecting numeric and mixed-type palindromes (and testing to support it).
